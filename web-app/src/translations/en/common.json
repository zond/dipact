      "paragraph-1": "<link1>Diplomacy</link1> is a game invented in the 50's by <link2>Allan Calhamer</link2>.",
      "paragraph-2": "Here you can find an introduction on how to play.",
      "paragraph-3": "It looks like Risk, with a war map and units, but unlike Risk has no element of chance. All units have equal strength; the only way to win is to convince other players to help you (and ultimately betray them). This real, human connection is more important than the tactical aspect.",
      "paragraph-4": "During a turn, players play in parallel; firstly, during a fixed time, players just talk to each other (in groups or private); making alliances, agreements, pass information. During this phase they submit secret orders for their units.",
      "paragraph-5": "After the time ends, all orders are revealed simultaneously, showing who supported or betrayed who. Battles are resolved, units build or destroyed, and the next turn starts, until one player controls enough of the board to be the winner.",
      "paragraph-6": "This is why Diplicity games take a long time. 'Playing' is mostly chatting with others. Turns usually take a day or more."

        "paragraph-3": "<i>Private</i> games are unlisted and require members to share a link for others to join.",
        "paragraph-4": "Games will only start when full; this can sometimes take a long time.",

        "title": "Reliability",
        "paragraph-1": "Diplomacy is a game where players who stop responding make it unbalanced, boring, and no fun for anyone. Reliability awards active players by letting them join other active players.",

        "paragraph-1": "Your first game might have some players who don't respond.",
        "paragraph-2": "Even when losing, other players are assholes, or you don't feel like playing anymore, it's important to keep sending orders. This will raise your reliability so your next games can be of higher quality. Even submitting some random orders each turn is enough to make a huge positive difference to the game"

        "title": "Using Google Account Info",
        "paragraph-1": "We use your account name and avatar to refer to you when you interact with other players. After a public game ends,this info (together with your message history) becomes accessible to all Diplicity players. Unfortunately, we had to do this to reduce verbal abuse and keep the atmosphere friendly.",
