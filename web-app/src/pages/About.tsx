						It looks like Risk, with a war map and units, but unlike

						During a turn, players play in parallel; firstly, during

						After the time ends, all orders are revealed

					</Typography>
					<Typography variant={"body2"}>
						You either create a new game or join one already created
						(we suggest an almost full one).
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant={"body2"}>
						<i>Public games </i>are listed in the Open games list
						for anyone to join.

					<Typography variant={"body2"} paragraph>
						<i>Private</i> games are unlisted and require members to
						share a link for others to join.
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant={"body2"}>
						Games will only start when full; this can sometimes take
						a long time.
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant={"body2"} paragraph>
						You can always invite others to speed this up using the

						Reliability
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant={"body2"}>
						Diplomacy is a game where players who stop responding
						make it unbalanced, boring, and no fun for anyone.
						Reliability awards active players by letting them join
						other active players.
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant={"body2"} paragraph>
						We recommend creating and joining games with a minimum
						reliability requirement of at least 10 (or as high as
						your reliability allows).

						variant={"subtitle2"}
						style={{ fontWeight: 700 }}

						Raising Reliability
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant={"body2"}>
						Your first game might have some players who don't
						respond.
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant={"body2"} paragraph>
						Even when losing, other players are assholes, or you
						don't feel like playing anymore, it's important to keep
						sending orders. This will raise your reliability so your
						next games can be of higher quality. Even submitting
						some random orders each turn is enough \ to make a huge
						positive difference to the game.

						Using Google Account Info
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant={"body2"}>
						We use your account name and avatar to refer to you when
						you interact with other players. After a public game
						ends,this info (together with your message history)
						becomes accessible to all Diplicity players.
						Unfortunately, we had to do this to reduce verbal abuse
						and keep the atmosphere friendly.
					</Typography>
					<Typography variant={"body2"} paragraph>
						If you do not want this, you can create a new, private
						game and play it with friends.
